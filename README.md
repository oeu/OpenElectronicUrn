    Welcome to the OEU project, do not hesitate to share your viewpoint and contribute if you wish.

    
    This is a 'just one file' project; the full documentation and the source code are a unique Python file; 'oeu.py'.
    This file includes all you need to understand and play with the project.


    To have formated documentation, run the 'oeu.py' file to build 'oeu.tex' (LaTeX) file, compile and print it.

    For your convenience, the 'oeu.pdf' PDF file is commited.

Enjoy!
